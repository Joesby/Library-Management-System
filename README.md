Thank you for using my Library Management System!
-------------------------------------------------------

I have tried to make my code read as clearly as possible,
but there are a few things to consider.

When searching for a book by title, the name must be spelled correctly and
spaces in between words MUST be included. However, the search is NOT case
sensitive, so capitalization isn't necessary.

When searching for a book by ISBN, white spaces MUST be included. I could spend
more time to reformat input and enhance the search experince, but I need to
move on to the rest of the bootcamp.

If you add in a new book and want to search for it, be sure to use the formatting you provided.
If you want to see an example of the formatting I use, please see the 'collection.txt' file.
Furthermore, if you want to import books automatically, please feel free to add in the book
information on a new line in the 'collection.txt' file-- using the same format I've
provided.
